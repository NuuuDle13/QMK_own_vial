This is a keyboard firmware forked from [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) with the ability to remap your keyboard in real time and adapt it to your needs through an added on GUI. This can be downloaded as an application or used in a browser, being an open-source cross platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) application. Vial adds several features to QMK's functions, and replaces others with near identical GUI enabled function

## Documentation

* [See the official  QMK documentation on docs.qmk.fm](https://docs.qmk.fm)

The docs are powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and hosted on [GitHub](/docs/). They are also viewable offline; see [Previewing the Documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/contributing?id=previewing-the-documentation) for more details.

You can request changes by making a fork and opening a [pull request](github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/pulls), or by clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page.

## Supported Keyboards

The project includes support for [lots of keyboards](/keyboards/).

If your keyboard isn't detected in Vial GUI or Web GUI, you are probably using a firmware that is not intended for Vial. For troubleshooting, please refer to the section 4 of [First Time Use](https://get.vial.today/manual/first-use.html)


To find out if an already ported firmware exists for your firmware, check if a keymap folder named `vial` exists [here](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/). 

If no folder named `vial` exists, the keyboard is not ported yet (or the firmware is available elsewhere!) and the keyboard folder is simply inherited from QMK. Start porting!

For tips on how to do it, follow the [porting guide](https://get.vial.today/manual/first-use.html).

## Supported Keyboards

The project includes support for [lots of keyboards](/keyboards/).

If your keyboard isn't working, your are probably using a firmware that is not intended for VIAL. For troubleshooting, please refer to the section 4 of [First Time Use](https://get.vial.today/manual/first-use.html)


If your keyboard isn't ported yet, you can contribute to VIAL's repository by creating your own firmware and porting it!

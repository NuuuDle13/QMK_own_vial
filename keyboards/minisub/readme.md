# Minisub

Minisub is a drop-in replacement PCB for MiniVan cases that supports multiple layouts with hotswap sockets. It was designed as an alternative to the MiniVan HS PCB and resolves some of the common complaints about that board. All hotswap sockets are positioned so switches are in the south-facing orientation; this resolves compatibility issues that some keycaps have with north-facing or rotated switches. PCB-mount stabilizers are supported for all three spacebars.
